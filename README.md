Login Page in C
This repository features a Login Page project built using the C programming language, designed to demonstrate basic user authentication in a console-based environment. It is an ideal example for beginners to learn about user registration, file handling, and implementing secure login systems in C.

Project Overview
The program provides a simple yet functional interface where users can:

Register an Account: Create a new account by entering a unique username and password.
Login: Authenticate their credentials to access the system.
Data Storage: Save user credentials in a file for persistence.
Error Feedback: Handle invalid inputs, such as incorrect usernames or passwords, and guide users appropriately.
Key Features
User Registration: Allows users to register their account with a secure password.
Secure Password Storage: Incorporates basic encryption techniques to store passwords securely (if implemented).
File Handling: Stores user credentials in a local file for later verification.
Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages for invalid login attempts or incorrect inputs.
Scalability: Can be extended to support multiple users or additional features like password recovery.
Technical Details
Language: C
File Handling: Used for reading and writing user data into a file.
Encryption: Basic encryption techniques can be implemented to enhance password security.
Modular Code: Designed with clear functions for better readability and maintainability.
