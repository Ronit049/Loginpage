C Login System

This is a simple C-based Login System that verifies a predefined username and password.

Folder Structure

LoginSystem/             # Main project folder
│-- login.c             # C program file (contains the login logic)
│-- README.md           # Project details and usage instructions
│-- .gitignore          # Git ignore file (optional)

How It Works

The program asks the user for a username and password.

It checks the input against predefined credentials.

If the input matches, it prints "Login Successful!", otherwise, it prints "Invalid Credentials.".

How to Use

Clone the Repository (if using GitHub):

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoginSystem.git
cd LoginSystem

Compile the Program:

gcc login.c -o login

Run the Program:

./login

Future Improvements

Implement user registration.

Store user credentials in a file or database.

Add a password encryption mechanism for security.

Login Page created through C programming language
This repository features a Login Page project built using the C programming language, designed to demonstrate basic user authentication in a console-based environment. It is an ideal example for beginners to learn about user registration, file handling, and implementing secure login systems in C.

Project Overview
The program provides a simple yet functional interface where users can:

Register an Account: Create a new account by entering a unique username and password.
Login: Authenticate their credentials to access the system.
Data Storage: Save user credentials in a file for persistence.
Error Feedback: Handle invalid inputs, such as incorrect usernames or passwords, and guide users appropriately.
Key Features
User Registration: Allows users to register their account with a secure password.
Secure Password Storage: Incorporates basic encryption techniques to store passwords securely (if implemented).
File Handling: Stores user credentials in a local file for later verification.
Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages for invalid login attempts or incorrect inputs.
Scalability: Can be extended to support multiple users or additional features like password recovery.
Technical Details
Language: C
File Handling: Used for reading and writing user data into a file.
Encryption: Basic encryption techniques can be implemented to enhance password security.
Modular Code: Designed with clear functions for better readability and maintainability.
How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/login-page-c.git  
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd login-page-c  
Compile the code using GCC or another C compiler:
bash
Copy
Edit
gcc login.c -o login  
Run the program:
bash

Edit
./login  
Future Enhancements
Implement advanced encryption techniques (e.g., hashing algorithms like SHA or MD5).
Introduce user roles such as admin and guest.
Add features like password recovery and multi-factor authentication.
Upgrade to a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
